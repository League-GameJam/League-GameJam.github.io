  <h1>
    The Contest:
  </h1>
    <p>When the countdown reaches 0, a link will become available to a GitHub Classroom assignment. The assignment is an empty repository that registered contestants will use to submit their code. Contestants will then have two weeks to build their game using either Java or Processing.</p>
    <p>
      In addition to the GitHub link becoming available, a theme will also be announced. All submitted games must fit within this theme. Once the deadline is reached, the GitHub Classroom assignment will become locked and no further changes to the game will be permitted. The games will then be judged and winners will be chosen based on the following catagories:
    </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Best Overall Experience</li>
    <li>Best Interpretation of Theme</li>
    <li>Best Graphics</li>
    <li>Best Use of Input Devices (mouse, keyboard, gamepad, etc...)</li>
    <li>Best Game from a Beginner Coder</li>
  </ol>
